# BasicTools-CountOut
Every so often I come across a server on discord that has a channel just for counting. 

This script asks for a number then types it out (pressing enter each time) and keeps couning from there.
FailSafe includes putting mouse into top left corner of screen, pausing the count untill enter is hit on the terminal.


Why?
Because I can and it's funny to watch someone think you just sat there and typed out 5 through 5000.
